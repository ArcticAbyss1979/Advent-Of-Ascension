Goblins are generally considered a pest by most landowners and explorers, and are generally mostly well known for their destructive, provocative tendencies.
While technically a humanoid, Goblins are entirely unrelated to the human species, and evolved separately. Regardless of this, they have evolved some sort of primitive intellect, and are able to communicate with each other.

They are known to be aggressive for no other reason than their limited intelligence, but thankfully they aren't of much danger since they possess limited-to-no weaponry and no real attributes of note.
